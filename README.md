# How long you spent on the assignment.
~930am-12pm plus about 30 minutes thinking about it beforehand
# What you like about your implementation.
I think it is a compact timeline visualizer that is compact and conveys a lot of information and would be useful in an airtable context where you are pivoting on various characteristics
# What you would change if you were going to do it again.
- finish implementing date range changing
- decide on a styling pattern
- better animations
- decide on behaviors for each interaction based on user research
# How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
When I read the task description, I initially thought of github contribution timelines. I also had seen a little bit of airtable's timeline ui in some videos
# How you would test this if you had more time.
Generally speaking, Jest with basic unit tests for all of my utility functions and sorting
Enzyme or react-testing-library for ui unit/integration/e2e tests
